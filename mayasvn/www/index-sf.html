<h1><span style="float: right; vertical-align: middle;"><a href="http://sourceforge.net"><img src="http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=149096&amp;type=1" width="88" height="31" border="0" alt="SourceForge.net Logo" /></a></SPAN>mayasvn</H1>
<p>This is a Maya Subversion integration system to make it easier for your team to use subversion to manage Maya assets</P>
<h2>Important:</H2>
<p>This is current only compiled for Maya 6.5.  If you have another version you'll have to download the source and re-compile.  It's also currently Windows only.  I don't use Maya on a OS X or under Linux, sorry.</p>
<h2>usage:</H2>
<p>Usage is straight forward.  Once installed if you attempt to open a maya file that is under subversion control you will be asked if you want to get a lock on the file.  If you answer yes mayasvn will attempt to lock the file.  If you answer no or if you choose not to lock the file you will be warned that you are not allowed to edit the file.</p>
<p>When saving mayasvn will check if the file you are saving is under subversion control.  If it is you will be asked if you want to commit the file.  If it is not, mayasvn will check if the folder you are saving to is under subversion control.  If so you will be asked of you want to add the file to subversion.  In either case if you answer yes you are given the option to enter a comment and to then to optionally get the lock again if you want to continue to edit the file.</P>
<h2>installation:</h2>
<h3>Simple (non production) installation for testing</h3>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the subversion client files are installed and in your path. (ie, you should be able to type "svn help" from the command line</P>
<li>Copy the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/mayasvn/mayasvn/mayasvncmd/plugin/6.5/mayaSvn.mll">mayaSvn.mll</A> to the <span class="fname">X:\Program Files\Alias\Maya&lt;ver&gt;\bin\plug-ins</SPAN></P>
<li>Copy <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/mayasvn/mayasvn/mayasvncmd/SVNSetup.mel">SVNSetup.mel</A> <span class="fname">My Documents\Maya\&lt;ver&gt;\scripts</SPAN></P>
<li>Run Maya, Go to Window->Settings/Preferences->Plug-in Manager..., find mayaSvn.mll and check both "loaded" and "auto load"</P>
<li>Next you need to add some code to your userSetup.mel file to enable it.  userSetup.mel is usually found in <span class="fname">My Documents\Maya\&lt;ver&gt;\scripts</SPAN>.  If it does not exist just create it.  Here is the simplest version</P>
<pre>
// -- userSetup.mel
SVNSetup(1);
</PRE>
<p>That's it. If you now try to open or save a file that happens to be in a subversion controlled folder you should get asked the appropriate subversion related questions</P>
    </OL>
<h3>Production Installation (for team settings)</h3>
<p>The point of this type of installation is so you can update things and your whole team can be brought up to date.</P>
<ol><li>Install the subversion client files somewhere inside your subverison controlled project tree.  They do NOT have to be in your path.  This way you can update the team with a new version of the client if/when you need to.  For this example I'm going to assume <span class="fname">e:\work\projectx\tools\svn</span> where <span class="fname">e:\work\projectx</SPAN> is the root of the subversion controlled tree for this project.  Add it to subversion</P>
<li>Copy the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/mayasvn/mayasvn/mayasvncmd/plugin/6.5/mayaSvn.mll">mayaSvn.mll</A> to a subversion based folder somwhere inside your subversion controlled project tree.  In this example <span class="fname">e:\work\projectx\tools\maya\6.5\plugins\mayasvn.dll</SPAN>.  Add it to subversion</P>
<li>Copy <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/mayasvn/mayasvn/mayasvncmd/SVNSetup.mel">SVNSetup.mel</A> in there as well.  <span class="fname">In this example e:\work\projectx\tools\maya\6.5\scripts</SPAN>.  Add it to subversion</P>
<li>Set an environment variable (right click My Computer, pick the "Settings" tab and click on "Environment Variables".  Click "Add" and type "PROJECTX_BASE" for the name and "<span class="fname">E:\work\projectx</SPAN>" for the value. Click "OK", "OK", "OK.</P>
<li>Edit your Maya.env file found in <span class="fname">My Documents\Maya\&lt;ver&gt;</SPAN>.  If it doesn't exist create it and put this code inside</p>
<pre>
MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH = %PROJECTX_BASE%\tools\maya\6.5\scripts\
</pre>
<p>that way Maya will look to our subversion controlled folder for scripts.
<li>add code like this to your userSetup.mel file.  userSetup.mel is usually found in <span class="fname">My Documents\Maya\&lt;ver&gt;\scripts</SPAN>.  If it does not exist just create it.</P>
<pre>
// -- userSetup.mel
ProjectXSetup;
</PRE>
<p>we do it this way because userSetup.mel is a local file and can't be easily managed from subversion but ProjectXSetup.mel can so lets have that do our real work and make that subversion controlled.</p>
<li>create ProjectXSetup.mel in <span class="fname">e:\work\projectx\tools\maya\6.5\scripts</SPAN>.  Here's the contents</P>
<pre>
// ProjectXSetup.mel
global proc ProjectXSetup()
{
    // don't enable it if we are in batch mode
    if (!(`about -batch`))
    {
        string $base = `getenv "PROJECTX_BASE"`;
        string $temp = `getenv "TMP"`;
        string $localCopy = $temp + "/mayaSvn.mll";
        string $svnCopy   = $base + "/tools/maya/6.5/plugins/mayaSvn.mll";

        // we copy it local and use it there otherwise it will be locked
        // and in use while maya is running making it impossible to update.
        sysFile -copy $localCopy $svnCopy;

        loadPlugin($localCopy);

        SVNSetup(1);
        // set the path to the svn client tools so it doesn't have to
        // be in our OS "path"
        SVNSetPath($base + "/tools/svn/bin");
    }
}
</PRE>
<li>Configure subversion to make .mb files need locks by default.  To do this edit the file <span class="fname">c:\documents and settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\Subversion\config</SPAN>.</P>
<p>Uncomment or add a line under the [miscellany] section</P>
<pre>enable-auto-props = yes</PRE>
<p>in the [auto-props] section add this line</P>
<pre>*.mb = svn:needs-lock=*</PRE>
<p>these lines make subversion actually make maya files read-only if you don't have the lock on them as well as require you to lock the file before you are allowed to commit.  In otherwords they make .mb files use the checkout-modify-checkin method of version control which is pretty much required for binary files.</P>
    </OL>
<h2>Notes - Comments:</H2>
<p>At first I thought it would be good enough if mayasvn
worked as follows</P>
<ol>
<li> When Loading a file
  <ol>
  <li> check if it's under subversion control
  <li> if it is check the lock status
      <ol>
     <li> if it's already locked say:
        "it's locked by --- do NOT edit!"
     <li> if it's not locked ask if they want to lock it
        <ol>
        <li> if yes, get lock
        <li> if not print "do NOT edit!"
        </OL>
     <li> if they already have the lock just proceed
     </OL>
  <li>load the file
  </ol>

<li> When Saving
  <ol>
  <li> check if it's under subversion control
  <li> if yes ask if they want to commit
  <li> if no check if the folder they are saving to is
     under subversion control
  <li> if yes, ask if they want to add (and commit)
  <li> if they commited, ask if they want the lock again
     if no, print "don't EDIT!"
  </OL>
</OL>
<p>So, I implemented that with the intention that the artists
would edit pretty much only subversion controlled files
with the svn:needs-lock property set.  The svn:needs-lock
property makes files use the lock-modify-unlock mode
instead of the default edit-update-commit mode.</P>

<p>Well, I ran it by my artists and they hated it</P>
<ul>
<li> They don't want to be asked "do you want to commit"
everytime they save.  They say they save several times a
minute pressing Ctrl-S just in case maya crashes and that
dialog would interrupt them.

<li> They hate the idea of one maya file with history saved
away somewhere inside a log that's hard to deal with.
Instead they want to continue their current way which is,
if they have a file called
<blockquote><span class="fname">stage_icelevel01.mb</SPAN></blockquote>

<p>they keep adding version numbers and other notes like this</P>

<blockquote>
<span class="fname">stage_icelevel01_001.mb</SPAN><br/>
<span class="fname">stage_icelevel01_002.mb</SPAN><br/>
<span class="fname">stage_icelevel01_20050815.mb</SPAN><br/>
<span class="fname">stage_icelevel01_withboxes.mb</SPAN><br/>
<span class="fname">stage_icelevel01_003.mb</SPAN><br/>
<span class="fname">stage_icelevel01_003_and_tgs_images.mb</SPAN><br/>
</blockquote>
</UL>
<p>Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.....</P>

<p>The solution I am currently using is this.</p>

<p>We have a project folder tree managed by subversion.  In
that tree there is a folder for stages and folder for
objects(characters/etc).  Something like this</P>

<pre>
  project
  +-data
    +-stages
      +-stage icelevel01
      | +-scenes
      | | +-stage icelevel01.mb
      | +-sourceimages
      |   +-background.tga
      |   +-flower.tga
      +-st lavalevel23
        +-scenes
        | +-st lavalevel23
        +-sourceimages
          +-lava.tga
          +-hotlavaanim001.tga
          +-hotlavaanim002.tga
</pre>

<p>etc..</P>

<p>the artists currently edit their levels outside of that
tree somewhere else local on their HD.  The plans is, when
they open a file in maya
<span class="fname">e:\myworkspace\folder\scenes\stage_icelevel01_tgs_images.mb</SPAN>

<p>mayasvn will figure out the basename, in this
case "<span class="fname">stage_icelevel01</SPAN>" and search for a corresponding
file in the project folder. If found then we check if they
have the lock, if not they are asked if they want it.  If
yes we attept to get it which includes getting the current
version.  We also update the folder tree, in this
case "<span class="fname">svn update project\data\stages\stage_icelevel01</SPAN>" to
make sure we have the current textures.  Then, we check if
the mb file they clicked on (the one not in svn) matches
the file in svn.  If not they are asked to select a place
to save the the svn file locally (because it's the most
recent file).  After they pick a place to save it (they
could just save on top of the file they original clicked
on if they want) then copy the svn file there AND copy all
the textures in <span class="fname">project\data\stages\stage_icelevel01\sourceimages</SPAN> to whereever they saved the svn file in the
corresponding soruceimages.  In otherwords, if they saved
the svn file to
<span class="fname">e:\myworkspace\folder\scenes\stage_icelevel01_most_recent.mb</SPAN> then textures would get copied to
<span class="fname">e:\myworkspace\folder\sourcefiles</SPAN>.  The textures, like
the .mb file are check and are only copied if they are
different and after warning the artist and giving them a
change to abort.</P>

<p>Checking in follows a similar procedure.  They are editing
<span class="fname">e:\myworkspace\folder\scenes\stage_icelevel01_tgs_images.mb</SPAN>
They click "check in level" (an icon in Maya) and knowing
the file is a level it knows to put it in
<span class="fname">project\data\stages\stage_icelevel01\scenes</SPAN> and the
textures in <span class="fname">project\data\stages\stage_icelevel01\sourceimages</SPAN>.</P>

<p>After checking in the get the option to keep the lock.</P>

<p>This basically lets them work as they always have but
hopefully still does content management.</P>

<p>So far there are a few problems</P>
<ul>
<li>it's not a very generic solution. It seems pretty much
tied to our environment.  I've made it so you can pass in
a list of project folders.  In the case above you'd pass
in <span class="fname">project\data\stages and project\data\objects</SPAN> so it can
find stuff.  That kind of works for checking out and
checking it, it doesn't work for adding though since
mayasvn doesn't know whether to add to stages or objects.
I suppose I could ask.

<li>textures can't really be shared.  (actually we do have
a shared texture tree and any textures in that tree are
ignored during this process but it's just one tree)

<li>when checking out I copy all the textures in
subversion's sourceimages folder.  When checking in
though, I copy all textures the .mb references that are
not in the shared tree.  The problem where is that the
only way in Maya to copy all referenced textures is to run
the animation and check which textures are referenced
(texture animation).  My exporter does this and so that
info is around for me but it's not a generic solution.  I
could write a plugin to help mayasvn do this without my
exporter but there is actually no full proof way to do it
since expressions and other stuff can decide what textures
are referenced and there's no way to know how those
expressions change over time except to pass in every
possible timevalue (which is impossible as well).  I
suppose in most cases you'd get most of the textures but
not always.
</UL>
<p>Any thoughts.  Should I have just forced my artist to use
the first solution?</P>
<p>75% of that solution is already checked in.  Instead of calling SVNSetup(1); like above you do it more like this</p>
<pre>
// ProjectXSetup.mel
global proc ProjectXSetup()
{
    // don't enable it if we are in batch mode
    if (!(`about -batch`))
    {
        string $base = `getenv "PROJECTX_BASE"`;
        string $temp = `getenv "TMP"`;
        string $localCopy = $temp + "/mayaSvn.mll";
        string $svnCopy   = $base + "/tools/maya/6.5/plugins/mayaSvn.mll";

        // we copy it local and use it there otherwise it will be locked
        // and in use while maya is running making it impossible to update.
        sysFile -copy $localCopy $svnCopy;

        loadPlugin($localCopy);

        SVNSetup(2); // 2 = solution/mode #2 :-p

        // set the path to the svn client tools so it doesn't have to
        // be in our OS "path"
        SVNSetPath($base + "/tools/svn/bin");

        // pass in a string array of scene paths
        // when a local file is opened these paths
        // will be checked for a matching file
        SVNSetProjectPaths({ $base + "/stages" });

        // pass in a string array texture path gmatch patterns
        // any texture path that matches one of these patterns
        // will be assumed to be shared.  We are using Alias's
        // leveltools package and we keep shared stuff in
        // a folder called leveltools somewhere in the project
        SVNSetTexpathExclusions({ "*leveltools*" });
    }
}
</PRE>
<p>What's missing is the checkin part. It's half written but I already had a separate custom checkin script that's not part of this package so I haven't gotten around to re-writing it here.</p>
<p>note that, for any file opened that does NOT match a file in the defined project paths the original rules apply, ie, check if the file is controlled by subversion directly and if so ask if they want the lock</P>
<h2>Localization</H2>
<p>Maya sucks at localization. Clearly something they didn't consider when starting Maya. I happen to work on a Japanese team which makes it even worse because basically Maya can't even display Japanese at all which forced me to write a plugin just so I could display dialogs in Japanese.  Maybe I can post that later.</P>
<p>If you want to localize the messages supply a callback function that takes an int msgid and returns a string.  Basically, copy the SVNGetEnglishMsg function from SVNSetup.mel and put it in your ProjectXSetup.mel.  Rename it.  Put "global" in front of "proc" and changes the messsages.  Finally add this line where you init the stuff.</P>
<pre>
        SVNSetMessageCallback("MyCustomMessageFunc");
</pre>
<p>of course change "MyCustomMessageFunc" to whatever name you named your function.</P>
<h2>Username translation</H2>
<p>There is another callback provided for username translation.  The issue was at my company our Windows user accounts are just employee numbers which is not very fun when mayasvn says user "s00321" has the lock on this file.  If you have such a system at your company you can provide a callback translation function something like this</p>
<pre>
// ProjectXSetup.mel
global proc string TranslateUserID (string $userid)
{
    if ($userid == "s00321") { return "gman"; }
    if ($userid == "s00412") { return "boomer"; }

    return $userid;
}
</pre>
<p>in the setup section add this line</P>
<pre>
        SVNSetUserIDCallback("TranslateUserID");
</PRE>
<h2>Bonus!</H2>
<p>mayasvn is nearly 100% mel.  The only Maya API part is the mayasvn.mll plugin.  All it does is allow you to connect mel scripts to certain events in maya.  BeforeSave, AfterOpen, etc.  So here is a script that came in useful
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/mayasvn/mayasvn/bonus/FixTexturePaths.mel">FixTexturePaths.mel</A>.  You can attach it to the AfterOpen event with the following line</P>
<pre>
eval mayaSvn -ae "\"AfterOpen\"" -sn "\"myAfterOpenScript\"" -m "\"eval FixTexturePaths\"";
</PRE>
<p>What it does is just after a maya loads a scene file it sets the Maya Project to the folder above the folder the scenefile is in.  In other words, if you keep your files organzied the maya way with a base folder and inside a scenes and sourceimages folder then instead of having to set the project before you open the file you can just open the file and your project will be set automatically. (that should probably happen in BeforeOpen but for now it's in AfterOpen).</P>
<p>After that it goes through every file texture and checks to see if it exists in <span class="fname">&lt;currentproject&gt;/sourceimages</SPAN>.  If it does it sets the path for that texture to the new path including making it project relative if possible.</P>
<p>I suppose for completely organized teams this is not important but for my team it seemed like every time I tried to open a file the textures would not come up.  I used Crow Yeh's excellent <a href="http://www.highend3d.com/maya/downloads/mel_scripts/data_management/1012.html">FileTextureManager</A> to manually fix all the paths but with this that fix is now automated.</P>
